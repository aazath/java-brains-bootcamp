    2. Clone the repository - Copy the forked repository into our local repository
    3. Create a new branch on our local repo
    4. Make the required changes
    5. Push the changes - before push the changes to the remote repo rebasing is  recommended
    6. Create a pull request 
    7. Review and discuss - once the pull request is made the owner/admin will be able to see our code and recommend any changes
    8. Merge or decline 
    9. Update and delete the branch  - deletion is recommended.
